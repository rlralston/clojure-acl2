;; Standard Rules
;;
;; The following are "standard" rules that we typically want to have in every
;; proof effort that we have engaged in.  We feel that this is a nice place
;; for these rules, because we very often want to reason about lists.

;; bzo (jcd) - Do we have this rule in many other places?  Would it be good
;; to "standardize" and use this one location (or put these someplace else)?

;(local (include-book "../util/iff"))

;; Note (jcd and ews): At one point, we tried strengthened this rule by moving
;; the consp hypothesis into the conclusion.  The modified rule was:
;;
;; (defthm equal-cons-cases
;;   (equal (equal (cons a b) c)
;;          (and (consp c)
;;               (equal a (car c))
;;               (equal b (cdr c)))))
;;
;; This rule turned out to be too strong.  It caused some proofs to fail, but
;; worse was the way that it slowed down proofs.  For example, bags/meta.lisp
;; originally took about 170 seconds, but using the new rule the time ballooned
;; to 1,200 seconds.  We have concluded that the original rule is what we
;; wanted, and so we have not changed the following:
; Hmmm.  Maybe the problem was that ACL2 unifies constant lists with cons?  Maybe a syntaxp test would help?  -ews

(defthm equal-cons-cases
  (implies (consp c)
           (equal (equal (cons a b) c)
                  (and (equal a (car c))
                       (equal b (cdr c))))))



;; As expected, ACL2 now has CONS-CAR-CDR, so we comment out all this stuff. -ews
;;
;; ;; bzo (ews and jcd) - This rule is inspired by the built in axiom
;; ;; car-cdr-elim.  We think that the case splitting version is better.  We have
;; ;; asked Matt Kaufmann to change ACL2 to provide the new rule instead, and
;; ;; he may change car-cdr-elim at some point in the future.
;; ;;
;; ;; So, when version 2.9.3 comes out, someone should check to see if this rule
;; ;; is now built in, and if so, remove this!

;; (jcd) - Originally there was a backchaining limit here of 0.  I have taken
;; this out.  I think that trying to establish (not (consp x)) should be
;; fairly cheap usually, even if some backchaining is allowed to occur.  And,
;; unless things are dramatically slower, I think that removing the limit is
;; justified on the grounds that this is clearly a strong "progress making"
;; rule, and we will want to have it fire whenever possible.

;; nice rules, so we started tracing type-set to figure out what was going on.
;; It turns out, that there is a function called type-set-cons, that
