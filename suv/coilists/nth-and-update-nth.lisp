;From eric's lemmas.  Drat.  I'm going to have to leave this disabled because
;it causes big problems when ACL2 rewrites an equality of two update-nth
;expressions.  Why?  Well, when ACL2 rewrites an equality of two known-consps,
;it tries to rewrite the equality of the cars and (sometimes) the equality of
;the cdrs.  In this case, that causes cdr-of-update-nth to fire and for some
;reason things start taking forever (probably because after pusing the cdr
;inside we are again left with an equality of two update-nth nests, albeit a
;smaller one).  Why that car-cdr hack is in the ACL2 code instead of being left
;to a rule is a mystery to me.  -EWS
